This is the source code for paper ”Unsupervised Adversarial Domain Adaptation for Cross-domain Face Presentation Attack Detection“

<img src="./overview.png" width = "600px" height = "250px" align=center />

## Environment

This code is based on Python2.7, Pytorch 0.4.0, torchvision 0.2, CUDA 8.0

## Data


Download the OULU-NPU, CASIA-FASD, Idiap Replay-Attack, MSU-MFSD and Rose-Youtu datasets

## Data Processing 
[SeetaFace algotithm](https://github.com/seetaface/SeetaFaceEngine) is utilized for face detection and face alignment. All the detected faces are normlaize to 256 x 256 x 3, where only RGB channels are utilized for training.

## Training
```
python main.py
```
